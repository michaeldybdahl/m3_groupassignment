## Problem statement:

**How can the sentiment of a review be predicted using NLP, deep learning and non-neural baseline models?**

Having all these reviews from customers who have bought the clothes online, it would be interesting to see if I can build some models that can predict whether a review has a negative or positive sentiment, especially the negative reviews can be interestering to look at - to see what the firm can improve.

I will use NLP to make a tidy format of the data and find the sentiment of the reviews.
